# Issues found during cp-3 and cp-4 testing

1. After taking a test and submitting the answer, the user interface places focus on the Fail button and places a check-mark next to the word Fail.  I would prefer that the focus is on a different button/element than pass/fail, and the check-mark if Fail is selected should be an X.  Continue to use a check-mark only if Pass is selected.
2. After completing a test, the UI returns to the home screen without performing any other tests, evn if the test was initiated on the main test screen with the "test all verses" button, of which there were 3 during testing.
