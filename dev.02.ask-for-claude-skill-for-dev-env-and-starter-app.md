We had to work through quite a few issues to complete and validate Phase 1 of our ccc.08.mvp-implementation-plan.md, which focused on creating a dev environment and getting an initial 'Hello World' app running.   I think we should make a 'claude skill' for creating this type of development environment and starter app.  This would be a skill for doing all the 'phase 1' stuff that we set out to do in ccc.08.mvp-implementation-plan.md.  The skill should be portable so that I can include it in future projects. I don't know much about claude skills, so I will rely on you for writing it in a future session. For now, please create a prompt for an LLM-powered software development agent to create the claude skill in a separate session.  Please reference the various documents we created and used here so that the skill creation builds on our experience, including ccc.08.*.md (goal), ccc.09.*.md (dev env setup), ccc.10.*.md (checklist for validating dev setup), ccc.11.*.md (react 19 dependency conflict, renamed from ccc.011) and ccc.12.*.md (web expo react issues), as well as anything else useful such as the claude.md file.  Write your prompt, context info, links, etc to ccc.13.prompt-for-claude-skill-dev-env-starter-app.md.  Let me know if you have any questions.
