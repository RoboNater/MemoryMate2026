 I think we should make a 'claude skill' for creating this type of development environment and starter app, basically a skill for doing all the 'phase 1' stuff that we set out to do in ccc.08.mvp-implementation-plan.md.  I don't know much about claude skills, so I will rely on you for writing it in a future session. For now, please create a prompt for an LLM-powered software development agent to create the claude skill in a separate session.  Please reference the various documents we created and used here so that the skill creation builds on our experience, including ccc.08 (goal), ccc.09 (dev env setup), ccc.10 (checklist for validating dev setup), ccc.11 (react 19 dependency conflict, renamed from ccc.011) and ccc.12 (web expo react issues).  Write your prompt, context info, links, etc to ccc.13.prompt-for-claude-skill-dev-env-starter-app.md.
